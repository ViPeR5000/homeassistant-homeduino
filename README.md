## Introduction

Home Assistant integration for using various 433 MHz devices and sensors with a connected Arduino
Nano with [homeduino sketch](https://github.com/pimatic/homeduino).

This plugins supports all 433 MHz devices with [rfcontrolpy](https://github.com/rrooggiieerr/rfcontrolpy/)
[protocol implementations](https://github.com/rrooggiieerr/rfcontrolpy/blob/master/protocols.md).

## Features

* Sending and receiveing RF commands
* Supports RF switches, lights, motion and weather sensors
* Read and write local IO connected to the Arduino Nano
* Reading DHT11/DHT22 sensors connected to the Arduino Nano
* Allows multiple Homeduinos to be connected

## Hardware

A Homeduino exists of an Arduino Nano with homeduino sketch. An 433 MHz RF transmitter and receiver
can be connected to communicate with 433 MHz devices and local IO can be used to read inputs or
switch relays.

## Installation

### HACS

The recommended way to install this Home Assistant integration is by using [HACS][hacs].
Click the following button to open the integration directly on the HACS integration page.

[![Install Homeduino from HACS.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=rrooggiieerr&repository=homeassistant-homeduino&category=integration)

Or follow these instructions:

- Go to your **HACS** view in Home Assistant and then to **Integrations**
- Open the **Custom repositories** menu
- Add this repository URL to the **Custom repositories** and select
**Integration** as the **Category**
- Click **Add**
- Close the **Custom repositories** menu
- Select **+ Explore & download repositories** and search for *Homeduino*
- Select **Download**
- Restart Home Assistant

### Manually

- Copy the `custom_components/homeduino` directory of this repository into the
`config/custom_components/` directory of your Home Assistant installation
- Restart Home Assistant

## Adding a new Homeduino Transceiver

- After restarting go to **Settings** then **Devices & Services**
- Select **+ Add integration** and type in *Homeduino*
- Choose *Homeduino Transceiver*
- Select the *Serial port* or enter the path manually
- Select the *Baud rate*
- Define which digital and analog IO should be enabled.
- Select **Submit**

When your wiring is right a new Homeduino integration and device will now
be added to your Integrations view. If your wiring is not right you will get a
*Failed to connect* error message.

### Digital and analog IO

The Arduino Nano suports 12 digital IO and 8 analog inputs which can be used by the Homeduino integration

The digital IO can be configured as:
- RF receiver on digital IO 2 or 3
- RF sender on all digital IO
- Digital input on digital IO 2 till 12
- Digital output on all digital IO
- PWM output on digital IO 3, 5, 6, 9, 10 and 11 
- DHT11/DHT22 sensor on difital IO 2 till 12

The analog input reads a value between 0V and 5V and reports the measured value as a value between 0 and 1023. You can use a template sensor to use this value according to your needs.

## Adding a new RF Device

- After adding your Homeduino go to **Settings** then **Devices & Services**
- Select **+ Add integration** and type in *Homeduino*
- Choose *RF Device*
- Select the *Protocol* and give the *Device ID* and *Device unit* for your device
- Select **Submit**

## Actions

The integration supports actions so commands can be send which are (not yet) implemented.

`homeduino.send`
This action allows you to send any supported command to the Homeduino Transceiver.

```
action: homeduino.send
data:
  device_id: 9889db9c137907826b591de9390fc584
  command: RF send 4 3 453 1992 88 9228 0 0 0 0 01020102020201020101010101010102010101010202010202020202010102010102020203
```

`homeduino.rf_send`
This action allows you to send a RF command for supported protocols.

```
action: homeduino.rf_send
data:
  protocol: switch1
  id: 98765
  unit: 0
  state: true
  all: false
```

`homeduino.raw_rf_send`
This action allows you to send a raw RF command for unsupported protocols.

```
action: homeduino.raw_rf_send
data:
  command: 268 1282 2632 10168 0 0 0 0 020001000100010001000100010001000100010100010000010001000100010001000101000100010000010001010001000001010000010100000101000001000103
```
